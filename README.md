# qld_car_crash_data

Here are the files I used to present to the Brisbane Data Science Meetup on the 14th of November, 2019.

Unfortunately, there are interactive components in my presentation and thus 
cannot save my presentation as a static html file. To recreate the presentation,
clone this git repo, open the `presentation.Rmd` file in Rstudio and press 
"Run presentation".

I am looking to host my presentation, and will have an update soon.

Main files:

* `binomial.glm` - Main analysis I completed before going writing the presentation
* `presentation.Rmd` - Generates an ioslides presentation 
  - Requires `shiny` and `knitr`
  - Can take some time to load
  
Any questions, comments or clarifications, please email me or leave an issue!
